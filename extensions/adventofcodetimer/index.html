  <h2>Advent of Code Timer</h2>
  <p>
    A simple Firefox browser extension that times how long it takes you to do the daily challenges on <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The timing is started manually when a day is viewed and ends when both daily challenges have been completed.
    Times are displayed to the right of each day in the calendar view.
  </p>
